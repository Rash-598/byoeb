Question;Answer
"What is photosynthesis?";"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into food (glucose) and oxygen."
"What is meant by photosynthesis?";"Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into food (glucose) and oxygen."
"What are the three things plants need to live?";"Plants need water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide to survive. They use these three components to carry out photosynthesis."
"Why do plants appear green?";"Plants appear green because of a compound called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll reflects green light and absorbs blue and red light, allowing plants to capture sunlight for photosynthesis."
"Why are plants green?";"Plants appear green because of a compound called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll reflects green light and absorbs blue and red light, allowing plants to capture sunlight for photosynthesis."
"Where does photosynthesis occur in plant cells?";"Photosynthesis occurs in structures called chloroplasts within plant cells."
"What are the two main phases of photosynthesis?";"The first phase captures sunlight energy, storing it in a chemical called ATP. The second phase (Calvin Cycle) uses ATP to create sugar and organic compounds."
"Can the second phase of photosynthesis happen without sunlight?";"Yes, the second phase (Calvin Cycle) can occur without sunlight, even at night."
"Why are plants essential for oxygen production on Earth?";"Plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, making them the major source of oxygen in our atmosphere."
"What is cellular respiration?";"Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down glucose to produce energy (ATP) and release carbon dioxide as a waste product."
"Where does cellular respiration take place in cells?";"Cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondria of cells."
"What are the reactants of cellular respiration?";"The reactants of cellular respiration are glucose and oxygen."
"What are the products of cellular respiration?";"The products of cellular respiration are ATP (energy) and carbon dioxide."
"How does the water cycle work?";"The water cycle involves processes like evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Water evaporates from oceans and other water bodies, forms clouds, and eventually falls back to Earth as rain or snow."
"What is evaporation?";"Evaporation is the process by which water turns from a liquid to vapor due to heat from the sun."
"What is condensation?";"Condensation occurs when water vapor cools and forms droplets, leading to cloud formation."
"What is meant by condensation?";"Condensation occurs when water vapor cools and forms droplets, leading to cloud formation."
"Explain evaporation.";"Evaporation is the process by which water turns from a liquid to vapor due to heat from the sun."
"What happens during precipitation?";"Precipitation is the release of water from clouds in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail."
"What is precipitation?";"Precipitation is the release of water from clouds in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail."
"What role do plants play in the water cycle?";"Plants contribute to the water cycle by absorbing water from the soil through their roots and releasing it through transpiration (water vapor loss from leaves)."
"Why is the water cycle essential for life on Earth?";"The water cycle ensures a continuous supply of fresh water for plants, animals, and humans."
"Importance of water cycle?";"The water cycle ensures a continuous supply of fresh water for plants, animals, and humans."
"What is transpiration?";"Transpiration is the process by which plants release water vapor into the atmosphere through tiny pores (stomata) in their leaves."
"How does the water cycle connect Earth's surface and the atmosphere?";"Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and rivers, rises into the atmosphere, forms clouds, and eventually returns to the surface as precipitation."
"Why is understanding the water cycle important for environmental conservation?";"Understanding the water cycle helps us manage water resources, prevent droughts, and protect ecosystems."
